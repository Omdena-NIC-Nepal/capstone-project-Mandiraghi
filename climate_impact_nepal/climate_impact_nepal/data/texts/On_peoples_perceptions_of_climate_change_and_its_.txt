Abstract
The Hindu Kush Himalayan region is a global hotspot for climate change and highly vulnera-
ble to its direct and indirect impacts. Understanding people’s perception of climate change is
crucial for effective adaptation strategies. We conducted a study by using quantitative
(Household survey, n = 660) and qualitative data collection tools (Focus group discussion, n
= 12; In-depth interviews, n = 27) in central Nepal encompassing three altitudinal regions:
Lowland (<1000 m amsl; Terai region), Midland (1000–1500 m amsl; hilly region) and High-
land (1500–2100 m amsl; mountainous region). We analyzed 37 years (1981–2017) of cli-
matic data from respective districts (Lowland: Chitwan, Dhading; Midland: Kathmandu,
Lalitpur; Highland: Nuwakot, Rasuwa). People’s perception was compared with climate
extreme indices measured along these regions and evaluated if they accurately recognized
the impacts on the environment and human health. Our findings show significant climate
changes, including rising summer temperature, region-specific winter temperatures and
extended monsoon seasons in Nepal. Participants in our study accurately perceived these
trends but misperceived heavy precipitation patterns. Reported impacts are rise in crop dis-
eases, human diseases, vector expansion and climate induced disasters like floods, land-
slides, and water resource depletion, with perception accuracy varying by region. These
insights highlight the importance of understanding regional and cross-regional perceptions
in relation to climate data in order to develop tailored climate adaptation strategies. Policy-
makers can use this information to establish region-specific educational and communication
initiatives, addressing communities’ distinctive vulnerabilities and needs across diverse
landscapes. Such approaches can enhance equitable and effective climate resilience in
subtropical to alpine regions.

Introduction
Climate change is undoubtedly the most significant global health threat of the 21st century,
exerting both direct and indirect effects on human health, particularly for socially, economi-
cally, and culturally vulnerable populations [1–5]. Mountainous regions, such as the Andes,
Alps, and the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, are especially susceptible to the impact
of rising temperatures [6–9]. The consequences of increasing temperature and altered precipi-
tation patterns in these global warming hotspots are manifold, affecting both the environment
and public health. Glacial melting, water scarcity, and reduced crop production are prevalent
issues in these regions, profoundly impacting the well-being of the local population [7, 9–12].
The HKH region, in particular, is already experiencing notable climate change impacts affect-
ing people’s physical and mental health [7, 13, 14]. Thus, unpredictable weather linked to cli-
mate change will accelerate the spread of infectious diseases and increase the occurrence of
natural hazards and disasters in the HKH region [15]. The urgency of addressing these cli-
mate-related health challenges cannot be overstated. This study focuses on Nepal, a developing
country located in the HKH region, which has been identified as highly vulnerable to climate
change and its impacts [7, 13, 14, 16–20].
Understanding people’s perceptions of climate change is crucial when devising policy mea-
sures. These perceptions significantly influence their level of concern and subsequently impact
their motivation to take action [21, 22]. In order to foster transformative behavioral changes
within communities and implement effective and acceptable climate change policies, it is
essential to have a comprehensive understanding of people’s perceptions [18]. Moreover,
studying local concerns and responses within a global warming hotspot can further facilitate
global cooperation in mitigating the impacts of climate change [23]. In Nepal, several studies
have investigated people’s perceptions of climate change, but they all have limitations. Some
studies focused solely on perceptions without considering other factors [24–26], while others
compared perceptions with a limited set of climate indicators [27–31]. None of these studies
incorporated a comprehensive set of climate indicators along with people’s perceptions.
Instead, studies that included climatic data focused solely on annual mean, minimum, and
maximum temperatures and precipitation amounts (detail summary of published literature in
S1 Table) [17, 32–39]. However, combining social and extensive climatic data is crucial to eval-
uate the accuracy of people’s perceptions of climatic changes. In this regard, Shrestha et al.
[40] were the first to combine perception and climatic data, demonstrating that people in
Nepal primarily perceive temperature changes rather than precipitation changes. It is impor-
tant to note that the relationship between people’s perceptions and the reality of climate
change is influenced by the specific context. Nepal is divided into different altitudinal regions
from South to North, leading to elevation-dependent warming [17]. Thus, those shortcomings
from the previous studies motivated us to conduct the current study by coupling objective cli-
mate indicators with subjective people’s perception to fill the gaps. Therefore, we hypothesize
that people’s perceptions of climate change and its direct and indirect impacts may vary
among these altitudinal regions.
To test the hypothesis regarding variations in people’s perceptions across three different
altitudinal regions, we employed a cross-sectional mixed-method research design. Our
approach involved several steps: 1) we analyzed the annual and seasonal climate trends, includ-
ing climate extreme indices (detailed in Table 1), and examined the timing of monsoon onset
and withdrawal over the past 37 years.
This analysis covered a trend period of 37 years (1981–2017), and we compared the last 30
years (1981–2010) with the most recent 7 years (2011–2017). These investigations were con-
ducted in the Lowland region (<1000 m above mean sea level (amsl)), Midland region (1000–

whether people’s perceptions (P) aligned with the actual climate trends. This evaluation uti-
lized both quantitative data from household surveys (HHS) and qualitative data obtained from
focus group discussions (FGD) and in-depth interviews (IDI). 3) We assessed whether this
association between perceptions and climate trends varied across different altitudes. 4) Addi-
tionally, we examined whether people accurately perceived the direct and indirect impacts of
climate change, particularly on human health and other sectors, based on their place of resi-
dence. Overall, our research design aimed to investigate perceptions across altitudinal regions,
compare them with climate trends, and determine the accuracy of perceptions regarding the
impacts of climate change on various sectors.

Materials and methods
Ethical approval
The Ethical Review Board (ERB) of the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC), Government
of Nepal approved the protocol of this study (registration no. 381/2017). The objectives of the
study were explained to the local community people, community leaders and health profes-
sionals before the start of the data collection (household surveys, focus group discussions, in-
depth interviews). They were informed that participation in the study was voluntary and that
they could leave at any time during the interview or withdraw their consent to participate at
any point. We obtained written informed consent from all participants.

Study design and setting
In September and October 2018, a cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qual-
itative) was carried out in the Lowland, Midland and Highland regions of Central Nepal. Sec-
ondary climatic data was collected from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology
(DHM), Nepal. The quantitative data was collected by conducting household surveys (HHS)
and the qualitative data by conducting focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth inter-
views (IDIs). This concurrent mixed method design was adopted to triangulate the findings
[42]; where, the qualitative data helps to make statistical relations more understandable and
intense by using the citations or descriptive language and, thus, this enables a better under-
standing of the quantitative data [43, 44].
Study area
Central Nepal (Bagmati province) was selected as study area (Fig 1). The Bagmati province is
the largest province of Nepal in regard to the number of inhabitants (about 21% of the total
population; [45]. Six administrative districts (Lowland: Chitwan, Dhading; Midland: Kath-
mandu, Lalitpur; Highland: Nuwakot and Rasuwa) of Central Nepal were selected purposively
as they represent broad vertical cross-sections, extending along an altitudinal range from 100
m to 2,100 m above mean sea level (amsl). The study areas (districts) were categorized based
on altitudinal variations: Lowland (<1000 m amsl; Terai region), Midland (1000–1500 m
amsl; hilly region) and Highland (1500–2100 m amsl; mountainous region) to see whether
there were differences between climatic perceptions and real climatic trends at different altitu-
dinal regions. The study sites are connected via road network from South to North. The Low-
land and Midland are predominately urban areas with tropical to subtropical climates,
compared to the rural Highland, which experiences a temperate to alpine climate [46–48].
Lowland and Midland districts have relatively better concentration of resources, population,
physical infrastructure as well as economic and industrial activities compared to Highland dis-
tricts [49].
Climate data
To compare people’s perception on climate change with the instrumental data, we analyzed 37
years of climate data (temperature, precipitation) from nearby stations of the respective dis-
tricts within three regions (S2 Table; two weather stations per region: Lowland, Midland,
Highland). Firstly, 30 years (1981–2010) of weather data was used as the base period and a

period of seven years (2011–2017) of weather data was used as the recent time frame to match
with the people’s perceptions and, secondly, 37 years (1981–2017) of trend analysis was also
performed. Climate data was procured from the Department of Hydrology and meteorology
(DHM). The approximate distance between the weather stations and social sampling sites are
provided (S2 Table).
Annual and seasonal (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, winter) climate extreme
indices were calculated using the Climdex software based on the CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM
Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI; http://etccdi.pacificclimate.
org/, Table 1). Suspicious or erroneous data were replaced with missing values before the cal-
culation of the extreme indices (S3 Table), however, for a few of the years, the climate extreme
indicator values could not be calculated (S3 Table). Seasonal and annual climate extreme indi-
ces were graphically illustrated showing the last 30 years vs. the last 7 years using violin plots
(S1–S3 Figs). The indices SU, TR, FD, WSDI and CSDI were only illustrated/calculated annu-
ally (details in Table 1). A trend analysis over the last 37 years was conducted to describe the
overall annual and seasonal trends of the climatic changes in three altitudinal regions and
across those regions in Central Nepal, respectively. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope
methods were used to calculate the magnitude and significance of the overall trend in the cli-
mate time series data from 1981 to 2017 using an MS-Excel tool called MAKESEN’S (version
1.0) developed by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) in 2002 [50]. In addition, the

distributions of the annual and seasonal climate extreme indices calculated for the last 30 years
(1981–2010) vs. the last 7 years (2011–2017) were compared by means of nonparametric
Mann-Whitney tests. Mann-Whitney U-statistics were used to assess the observed versus the
perceived climatic changes in different altitudinal regions and across the regions of Central
Nepal. The software Prism v.9 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for all graphical
illustrations and statistical analyses.
Social survey
Quantitative data collection methods and sampling strategy.
Quantitative data was col-
lected by conducting 660 households surveys from six districts (Lowland: Chitwan and Dhad-
ing; Midland: Kathmandu and Lalitpur; Highland: Nuwakot and Rasuwa). In each district,
clusters including at least 100 private households were randomly selected for completing a
household questionnaire survey (S2 File). Since we did not have a sampling frame, we assume
our prevalence as 50% to maximize our sample size. With a 95% confidence level and 5%
allowable error, the sample size in each district was 96. i.e., n = z^2*P*Q/d^2 =
(1.96^2*0.5^2)/ (0.1^2) = 96. After adding 10% for non-responses, our sample size in each dis-
trict became 106, which was rounded to 110 for convenience and, thus, in total, 660 house-
holds (220 in each region: Lowland, Midland and Highland) were targeted for the household
survey.
The households for HHS were chosen in selected clusters along main roads with a 50 m
radius of transect employing a simple random sampling. All eligible individuals (aged 18 or
above and who had not moved away or died) were listed for each selected household and one
participant from that list was selected randomly to take part in the survey using the WHO-Kish
method [51]. A questionnaire for climate change perception previously used [43] was adapted
for this study. We collected primary data on (1) demographic information (age, education,
occupation, marital status, income, ethnicity and the type of residence of the participant), (2)
perceptions on the environmental and climate change, and (3) perceptions on the impacts of
climate change on human health and other sectors.
Quantitative data analysis.
The collected quantitative data was verified and entered in
the Epi Data 3.1 Software (EpiData Association, Denmark) and analyzed using the statistical
package for the Social Sciences software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24). Chi-
square tests were used to compare the socio-demographic characteristics and climate change
perceptions between the Lowland, Midland and Highland. The Fisher’s exact test was used
when appropriate, i.e., when more than 20% of the cells had an expected frequencies of <5
[52].
Qualitative data collection methods and sampling strategy.
Twelve focus group discus-
sions (FGD) with community people of the respective districts and 27 in-depth interviews
(IDIs) with local political leaders, community leaders, female community health volunteers
(FCHVs), teachers and public health professionals were carried out using a purposive sam-
pling method [53]. Based on the principal of saturation, the number of IDIs and FGDs were
determined [54, 55]. The FGDs and IDIs were conducted in the Nepali language by following
the semi-structured guidelines for interview and FGD guide (S3 File); information from these
discussions and interviews was recorded. In some cases (n = 2), interviews were not recorded
due to unexpected technical problems and only notes were prepared.
Qualitative data analysis.
Qualitative data analysis was performed using MAXQDA soft-
ware. First, FGDs and IDIs were transcribed in Nepali language and later translated into
English. To avoid bias in the translation and to validate the information, the translation was
double-checked by two study team members and then the English version of each transcript

was uploaded into MAXQDA. Initially, themes and sub-themes were defined based on find-
ings from the literature and were then used to create a ‘code list’ on climate change and its
impacts. Emerging themes from the transcripts were also incorporated. Using the code list, the
data were coded and recoded in the MAXQDA software, following the approach used in previ-
ous study [43]. The themes and subthemes were identified using a simultaneous deductive and
inductive approach [43, 44, 56]. The English transcripts were then coded with defined catego-
ries accordingly. Finally, all coded material per category was summarized and findings were
derived.
Comparison of people’s perception and climatic trends
We compared the perceptions of the people with the climate extremes by means of heat maps
(software: Prism v.9, Version 9, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego-CA, USA). The heat maps
(Figs 3 and 4) show the most common answer of the people per perception (given as a fraction
of the total answers) and the trend of the climate extreme indices (Sen’s slope and significance
of the Mann-Whitney U-statistics after FDR correction). We merged the sub-categories for
perceptions P1-P6 (S4 Fig) into main categories: P1) “very low” and “low” were summarized
as “decrease”, P2) “normal high” and “very high” as “increase”, and P4) “less shifting” and
“much shifting” were merged to “shifting earlier”, and, “less prolonging” and “much prolong-
ing” were merged and categorized as “prolonging”. Detailed results on P3 were present in P4
and P5 and therefore P3 was not included in the heat map (Fig 4).
The false discovery rate (FDR) was conducted per region and per perception using the
‘Two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli’ with a desired FDR of 5% (for
details see Figs 3 and 4). We also illustrated the monthly precipitation trends in the last 30
years vs. the last 7 years. In addition, to compare the people’s perceptions of the shift or pro-
longing of the monsoon season with timely data, the dates of the monsoon onset, the with-
drawal of the monsoon and the monsoon season length were downloaded from the
Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Kathmandu Nepal (http://dhm.gov.np/
download/) for the whole of Nepal (region-specific values were not present). The onset of the
monsoon in Nepal was determined by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology accord-
ing to the following factors: 1) the wind direction over South-Eastern Nepal at the surface and
upper levels should be south-eastern at the surface with a western direction jet wind towards
the Tibetan Plateau, 2) past three days of continuous rainfall should be present, 3) the air pres-
sure at the surface and upper levels should be a low pressure system, 4) the progression of
monsoon onset from the South to North from India is evaluated, and 5) outgoing longwave
radiation is investigated and should be reduced over Eastern Nepal. The monsoon onset and
withdrawal dates as well as the monsoon season length were analysed over time (37 years)
using the Mann- Kendall test and the Sen’s slope methods. In addition, the last 30 years vs. 7
years were compared with each other using a Mann-Whitney test.
Results
The climate in Central Nepal has undergone significant changes in recent decades, including
increasing summer temperatures, region-specific winter temperature increases, and an
extended monsoon season. People have generally perceived these temperature trends accu-
rately. However, there has been a misperception regarding a decrease in heavy precipitation
patterns across the regions. People have also reported both direct and indirect impacts of cli-
mate change. Across different altitudinal regions, they have particularly noted an increase in
crop diseases and the appearance of vectors in new areas. Furthermore, region-specific impacts
include floods, landslides, transmission of vector-borne diseases, and the depletion of water

resources. The participants from all study areas correctly perceived the growing threat of vec-
tor expansion.
Comparison of perception on direct climate change impacts and climatic
trends
People’s perceptions of meteorological and climatic changes and their impact on human health
generally aligned with the climate trends observed in the study areas (P = perception; P1, P2
for all areas; P2, P5 for Lowland and Midland; P4 for Midland and Highland), except for heavy
rainfall in recent years (P6; Fig 2). In summary, people accurately identified the overall increas-
ing trend in summer temperatures across all altitudinal regions (P1) and the region-specific
temperature trends in winter (P2; Table 2, Figs 2 and 3).
In the Lowland, HHS participants’ perception on a trend in winter cold was discordant
(feels same; 31.5%, decrease; 31.5%, increase; 30.6%), while the IDI and FGD participants

given. Significance of each data type is presented in detail in Figs 2–5. Qualitative data trend of people’s perception was evaluated by the authors. The trend in quantitative
data is always represented by the most frequently occurring value, if it is not clearly different from the others it was given as unclear (Figs 1 and 5). Climatic trend was
given by summarizing observed (significant) trends (Figs 3, 4 and S9 Fig). Brackets indicate only a small trend (climate = one or a few significant indices, temporal
shift = no significant trend). NA = data not available. Green color = social and climate data is matching. Grey color = one data type is missing, so a comparison is not possi-

reported an increase in winter cold (Table 2, Fig 3). In line, a clear significant temperature
trend in the Lowlands was not present (cool days (TX10P) increase, cool nights (TN10P)
decrease). The majority of participants in the Midland correctly perceived a decreasing trend
in winter cold, which aligns with observed climatic trends. In the Highland, the perception of
increasing winter cold was partly discordant with the observed climatic trend of a decrease in
winter cold over the past 37 years, although some data in the Highland were missing in the
past 30 years (Fig 3, S3 Table). Additionally, the number of frost days did not significantly
decrease in the Highland, unlike the Midland where all indices showed significant differences
in the past 7 to 30 years, and temperature extremes such as the number of cold days/nights
were increasing. These factors potentially explain why people perceived an increase in winter
cold in the Highland. The temperature trend in winter in the Lowland, as well as partly in the

Highland, was not as systematic and highly significant as in the Midland, which may contrib-
ute to the varying perceptions among people.
People correctly perceived a change in the monsoon rainfall pattern (P3, Fig 4, Table 2, and
S9 Fig). Although there was no clear systematic shift in precipitation-related climate extreme
indices (only small trends existed), the majority of participants from all altitudinal regions con-
sistently perceived temporal changes, such as an earlier start and prolonged monsoon season,
and increased heavy rainfall (P4, P5, P6; Fig 4).
Perceptions P3 and P5 align with the observed withdrawal of the monsoon and an increase
in the number of monsoon days (S9 Fig). However, when comparing climate data with quanti-
tative and qualitative data on the timing of monsoon rainfall (P4, P5), discrepancies were
found, indicating that people struggle to accurately identify temporal precipitation trends,
such as earlier/later onset and withdrawal (Table 2). Perception P6 showed a complete discrep-
ancy between people’s perception and climate data (Table 2, Fig 4). People perceived increas-
ing rainfall in all regions of Central Nepal, despite the fact that the number of heavy
precipitation days was decreasing (Table 2, Fig 4).
Comparison of perception on indirect climate change impacts and climatic
trends
People in Central Nepal also perceived various indirect impacts of climate change (P7-P15;
Table 2, Fig 5). Direct impacts, such as the drying-up of water resources (P7), were particularly
perceived in the Midland and Highland. Although people could not directly perceive the
decreasing trend in precipitation, they indirectly noticed the drying-up of water resources,
which indicated this negative trend (P7; Fig 5).
Additionally, an increase in floods and landslides was mostly reported in the Highland
(HHS), while participants in the Lowland and Midland (IDI and FGD) partly reported this
increase. Correspondingly, heavy precipitation (Rx5Day) and the number of wet days (CWD)
increased during the monsoon season in the Highland, potentially contributing to such events.
In the Midland, heavy precipitation events (Rx5Day) and overall annual heavy precipitation
(R95pTOT) also increased during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Furthermore,
people from each region perceived a decrease in snowfall days and snow cover (P14), as well as
an increase in the duration of droughts and drought-like conditions (P8) (Table 2, Fig 5). This
increase in droughts can be linked to a decreasing trend in annual rainfall patterns (R10mm,
R20mm, Rx5day, CDD; S9 Fig) observed in all regions.
Regarding indirect impacts, people in the Lowland and Midland perceived the presence of
mosquitoes (P9) and the transmission of vector-borne diseases in new areas (P10), while in the
Highland, people only perceived the spread of mosquitoes to new areas (Table 2, Fig 5). In addi-
tion, people (IDIs) reported the new occurrence of poisonous snakes (Cobra, Krait) in the High-
land areas in recent years (details in S4 File). People from all regions perceived an increase in crop
diseases (P12), but no new human diseases (P11) were reported (Table 2, Fig 5). However, FGD
and IDI participants from all regions reported a rise in non-communicable diseases, including
diabetes and hypertension. Additionally, they noted that seasonal flu has become more severe and
spreads more rapidly, with common colds now requiring longer recovery times despite previously
being manageable with simple remedies (S4 File). In general, participants (HHS, FGD, and IDI)
were able to distinguish between vector-borne diseases and other human diseases, although there
were differing perceptions regarding the occurrence of human diseases (HHS: no increase; IDI,
FGD: increase; Fig 5)382. Similarly, the IDI participants from all regions (Lowland, Midland,
Highland) have also reported that unusual rainfall patterns and climate-induced disasters along
with crop pests had adversely affected the production of food grains, vegetables and fruits.

Discussion
Mountainous regions, such as the Hindu Kush Himalayan region, are facing rapid climate
change and are particularly vulnerable to its direct and indirect impacts [6–9, 57, 58]. In our
study, we investigated people’s perceptions of climate and climate change in different altitudi-
nal regions of Nepal, which is part of the HKH region. Our findings provide valuable insights
into how people perceive climate warming and its impact on human health. We demonstrated
that observed climatic trends in Central Nepal are partially perceived accurately, although this
perception varies depending on participants’ residential areas and the extent of climatic
changes in those areas. Understanding the direct and indirect impacts of climate change, both
regionally and cross-regionally, can contribute to fostering public engagement and developing
effective communication and educational strategies regarding the connections between cli-
mate warming and health [18]. Furthermore, our results have global implications, serving as a
forecast for major aspects of climate change that will likely be perceptible to people in the
future from subtropical to alpine regions.

Our study on people’s perceptions of climate change revealed that participants accurately
perceived the seasonal temperature trends in different altitudinal regions, particularly during
summer and winter. In various areas of the HKH region, increasing temperatures were per-
ceived and sometimes supported by the observed temperature trends (detailed comparison of
people’s perception and temperature trends in multiple regions of the HKH region are sum-
marized in S1 Table). Consistent with Central Nepal, an overall increase in summer tempera-
tures was commonly perceived in the Lowland and Midland regions of the entire HKH region,
which aligns with previous studies conducted in other parts of Eastern, Western and Central
Nepal, and in other HKH countries like Bangladesh and India [25, 27–29, 31, 59, 60]. An ear-
lier onset of summer was perceived in general in Central Nepal and specifically by the High-
land communities, which is in line with previous studies from Eastern Nepal [31, 61]. Likewise
previous research conducted in Nepal [31], we found the Midland and Highland communities
perceived shorter winters, while a decrease in winter cold was perceived in the Lowland of
Central Nepal which is consistent with previous studies in Western Lowland parts of HKH
country, Nepal [27, 28]. In Central Nepal, the trend of decreasing winter cold was most pro-
nounced in the Midland, likely influenced by urbanization and the heat island effect [37, 62–
65]. Conversely, people in the Highland of Central Nepal perceived an increase in winter cold,
while in other HKH regions, this perception was only reported in the Lowland [66].
Our findings confirmed that in Nepal, changes in precipitation patterns and heavy precipi-
tation trends are not as noticeable as temperature changes [40]. The majority of people in the
Highlands perceived an increase in heavy precipitation, which may be related to the rising
trend of rainfall in those regions (PRCPTOT: 7.53mm/year, not significant). Since a significant
portion of Highland people engage in agriculture (33.5%; S5 Fig), they are likely to notice even
small changes in precipitation [67]. Overall, people in the HKH region perceived changes in
the monsoon rainfall pattern, particularly in terms of timing, although previous studies have
shown that perceptions of precipitation changes vary across different regions in the HKH
region [24–29, 31, 40, 59, 60, 66, 68]. In recent years (2005–2016), Nepal has experienced an
increase in indirect climate change impacts such as floods and landslides [58, 69]. This increase
may have led people in Central Nepal to perceive an increase in heavy rainfall, even though
heavy rainfall had actually decreased. From 2000–2009, compared to each other, Lowland dis-
tricts were highly affected by floods (including Chitwan, also in 2017), while Highland districts
were moderately and the Midland districts were less affected [69, 70]. Highland residents in
our study may have perceived more floods due to the increasing frequency of outburst floods
from glacial lakes [71]. Additionally, landslides have heavily impacted the Nuwakot district,
which is part of the Highland region [70, 72]. Indeed, loss of life and property due to extreme
rainfall events has already been reported in Nepal [69, 70, 73]. Such negative events have a sig-
nificant impact on the psychological well-being of individuals [74], potentially explaining why
people perceived an increase in heavy rainfall patterns. In general, people in the HKH region
perceived an increase in floods across all altitudinal regions, while an increase in landslides
was also frequently reported in the Midland and Highland regions, in line with previous stud-
ies [24, 29, 31, 40, 57, 59, 68]. In fact, a study in Nepal has also reported increasing frequency
of climatic disasters and, mortality due to these climate induced disasters since 3 decades
(1992–2021), highlighting the vulnerability of the Mid hills (Midland) and Mountains regions
(Highland) to landslides and the Lowland Terai regions to floods [57].
Furthermore, droughts in Central Nepal have become more severe and frequent [75], and
this increase has been perceived by people across all regions. Dryness or droughts have also
been perceived in other parts of the HKH region, highlighting the significant impact of global
warming [24, 29, 31, 40, 59, 68]. The agricultural sector, including agricultural production, is
affected by increasing temperatures and droughts caused by climate warming [7], reflecting

our findings. Additionally, the people from all regions of Central Nepal perceived an increase
in new crop diseases and the reduction in crop production. These findings are consistent with
previous studies in other parts of Western and Central Nepal where people also reported
declining of crop yield due to increase in new crop pests along with climate-induced disasters
[24, 31, 76]. This might be due to rising temperatures that influence reproduction, spread and
severity of numerous plants pathogens, while also causing a shifting of crop pathogens from
Lowland to Highland regions [77, 78]. Additionally, people in our study have also observed
changes in biodiversity, such as early flowering of plants, which is consistent with previous
studies conducted in Nepal [31, 68]. Similarly, people residing in Pakistan have also reported
changes in plant distribution (shift to higher altitudes), abundance, and flowering periods due
to climate change, aligning with our findings from FGDs in Central Nepal [79].
At the interface of biodiversity and health, health-threatening animals, such as venomous
snakes, are expanding their distribution to higher altitudes as perceived by the IDI participants
in our study and as demonstrated by previous studies conducted in Nepal [80, 81]. Another
health threat to humans is the altitudinal expansion of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria and
dengue) throughout the entire HKH region [14]. Vector-borne diseases and their vectors are
already common in the Low- and Midland regions (Fig 4- P4 and 5; [14, 16, 82, 83]), while cli-
mate change-induced vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, are projected to increase and
become more common at higher altitudes [14, 84]. Therefore, in the present study people
from Central Nepal, especially in Lowland regions, have correctly reported an increase or
emergence of vectors [24, 29, 66, 68]. In the Lowland region of Central Nepal, FGD and IDI
participants have experienced an increase in communicable (influenza) and non-communica-
ble diseases (diabetes, blood pressure). This observation aligns with research indicating a rise
in influenza in Nepal since 2004 [85, 86], as well as predictions that non-communicable dis-
eases will worsen across the HKH region [7].
In general, people’s motivation to take action on climate change is influenced by their level
of concern, which is influenced by their individual perceptions [21, 22]. Hence, increasing the
local, regional and cross-regional adaptive capacity will help to reduce the impacts of climate
change on the health and well-being of people residing in the Nepal specifically and the HKH
region in particular [7].
Conclusion and recommendations
This study could offer valuable insights into people’s perceptions of climate change in relation
to weather data, not only within the HKH region but also in other regions worldwide with sim-
ilar geographical landscapes. Our study provides also important insights into people´s percep-
tions on direct and indirect impacts of climate changes on human health, agriculture,
biodiversity and overall in environment in Central Nepal. The observed climatic trends in
Central Nepal are in part correctly perceived, which strongly depends on the residential area
of participants and the respective extent of climate changes. Thus, the level of understanding
of the direct and indirect impacts of climate change encompasses some regional and some
cross-regional aspects that could be helpful to build widespread public engagement and
develop effective communication and educational approaches on the interactions of climate
change and health in a region-specific manner. Globally, our findings provide a projection of
significant aspects of climate change that will likely be perceptible to people in the future. The
perceptions of Nepalese people and those living in the HKH region underscore the urgent
need for coping strategies to address declining agricultural productivity, prompting a recom-
mendation for local stakeholders and regional governments to focus on measures such as
improved water management practices for the dry season, adjusted sowing and planting

schedules, modified cropping patterns, and environmentally sustainable professional pest con-
trol methods which are already being in practiced by farmers in some parts of Nepal [87].
Also, countrywide biodiversity conservation strategies, combined with climate change mitiga-
tion and adaptation activities, are necessary, especially to mitigate the increasing heat. It is also
advisable to revise plans for coping with the impacts of climate change, especially for victims
of natural disasters, according to region-specific perceptions. Similarly, comprehensive infor-
mation and awareness campaigns addressing the risk of snakebites in highland regions, along-
side initiatives to enhance public understanding of vectors and vector-borne diseases, should
be implemented across all regions to encourage the adoption of effective preventive measures
[88]. Meanwhile, strengthening Nepal’s public health infrastructure and establishing early
warning systems for climate-sensitive and epidemic-prone infectious diseases in the HKH
region are essential to prevent further spread of vectors and vector-borne diseases. [7, 89].
Thus, we recommend that policymakers in Central Nepal and in general in the HKH region
focus on designing, communicating, and implementing climate adaptation strategies [90]
based on the direct and indirect climate change impacts that were primarily perceived in this
study. Those strategies should address both regional and cross-regional climate change
impacts.
Strengths and limitations
The strength of the present study lies in its cross-sectional mixed-method research design,
which combines different data sources on climate change and perception, including climatic
data and social data, sampled along an altitudinal gradient. This research design provided us
with the opportunity to triangulate the findings and gain a deeper understanding of the rela-
tionship between climate change and people’s perceptions. However, this study must be inter-
preted with caution regarding certain aspects. The data was collected in densely populated
urban and semi-urban areas of each altitudinal region, and therefore, the clustering of house-
holds within a 50 m radius around the data collection site may not be representative of the dis-
tricts and the entire country. Additionally, our study is focused exclusively on Central Nepal
(Bagmati province), the most populated region of Nepal. Considering the country’s significant
geographical and socio-economic diversity, conducting similar studies in other regions of
Nepal in the future could provide a more comprehensive understanding of climate variability
and its impacts across diverse geographical and socio-economic contexts. However, we have
also extensively reviewed the relevant literature to identify similarities and differences between
the different altitudinal regions in Central Nepal and other studies conducted in general in the
HKH region (S1 Table).
This is the first study that has identified region-specific as well as cross-region specific
impacts of climate change in the HKH region itself. The study underlines that transdisciplinary
research is essential and the first step to plan later effective implementation of mitigation and
adaptation strategies that would be accepted by the public in the face of climate change
impacts. A better understanding of people’s perceptions of climate change in a global warming
hotspot will likely help policymakers induce transformational behavioral changes not only in
the HKH region but also globally.
