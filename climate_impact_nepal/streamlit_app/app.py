    st.markdown("""
        This interactive dashboard was developed as a capstone project for the **Omdena NIC Nepal Local Chapter** with the aim of analyzing and predicting climate change impacts in **Nepal**. It combines geospatial, statistical, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to offer a comprehensive perspective on climate patterns, risks, and perceptions.

        ### üîç Key Capabilities:
        - **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed over time and region.
        - **Predictive Modeling:** Training machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Ridge, Lasso) to forecast key climate variables.
        - **GIS Visualization:** Mapping spatial distribution of climate metrics across districts using Folium and Streamlit-Folium.
        - **Text Analysis:** Extracting and analyzing public climate perception from PDFs using sentiment analysis, emotion classification, and named entity recognition.

        ### üõ† Tools & Technologies:
        - **Python** for scripting and data pipelines
        - **Streamlit** for front-end dashboard
        - **scikit-learn**, **xgboost** for modeling
        - **nltk**, **spaCy**, **TextBlob** for NLP
        - **folium**, **geopandas**, **rasterio** for spatial analysis
        - **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **plotly** for visualization

        ### üë§ Project Author:
        **Mandira Ghimire**  (Omdena Student)
        - [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Mandiraghi)  
        - [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandirag/)

        This dashboard is part of a broader initiative to integrate data science with sustainability and policy-making for climate resilience in vulnerable regions like Nepal.
